    'Time is a priceless asset. The time, once lost, cannot be reclaimed and reused ever. That is why we must harness the time available in such a way, to get the most benefit out of it. Success only approaches when a person utilizes his/her time suitably and efficiently.',
    'The skill of time management will make more goals oriented and help one realize dreams. The first thing that one can do is to make a list of daily activities. It should include even the activities one doesnâ€™t consider necessary. Next, decide on the priority levels of every activity based on its urgency.',
    'The most important ones like arriving on time, brushing, bathing, studying etc. should be on top and the least ones like watching TV, chatting etc., may be left out. Now, one should decide on the time duration one is going to spend on each activity and stick to it. For example, if one decides to self-study for five hours every day, then one must stick to this decision.',
